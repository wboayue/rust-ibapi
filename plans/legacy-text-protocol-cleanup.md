# Legacy Text-Protocol Cleanup Tracker

**End goal:** support protobuf-only on the wire (both directions) and delete every text-protocol code path from the crate.

## Status today

- **Outgoing:** all requests are protobuf. The text encoders are gone (PRs #449–#452, summarized in [protobuf-migration.md](protobuf-migration.md)).
- **Incoming:** decoders are still mostly text-only with a small number of dual-format (`decode_proto_or_text`) call sites. The wire flips a message family from text to protobuf at a per-family server-version gate, so text-decode code stays load-bearing until the minimum server version we accept covers every gate.
- **Connection gate:** `connection::common::require_protobuf_support` rejects servers below `server_versions::PROTOBUF_SCAN_DATA` (210) — gate added in [#492](https://github.com/wboayue/rust-ibapi/pull/492); floor ratcheted 201 → 203 in [#527](https://github.com/wboayue/rust-ibapi/pull/527), then 203 → 210 in [#530](https://github.com/wboayue/rust-ibapi/pull/530) (skipping 204–209 in one move because every family in that range already has a proto decoder + `decode_proto_or_text` wrapper). Decoders weren't deleted as part of the bump — that's a follow-up PR after each family's response-format mapping is grounded in captured wire data (the `OutgoingMessages`-based grouping in C# Constants.cs maps to outgoing requests, not the responses we decode). Next ratchet candidate: 211 (`PROTOBUF_REST_MESSAGES_1`).

## Per-family protobuf-incoming gates

From `src/server_versions.rs`. A response in family X is protobuf iff `server_version >= GATE[X]`. We can delete that family's text branch only after the floor passes the gate.

| Family                  | Constant                       | Min version |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|------------:|
| Connection (StartApi)   | `PROTOBUF`                     |         201 |
| PlaceOrder              | `PROTOBUF_PLACE_ORDER`         |         203 |
| CompletedOrder          | `PROTOBUF_COMPLETED_ORDER`     |         204 |
| Contract data           | `PROTOBUF_CONTRACT_DATA`       |         205 |
| Market data             | `PROTOBUF_MARKET_DATA`         |         206 |
| Accounts & positions    | `PROTOBUF_ACCOUNTS_POSITIONS`  |         207 |
| Historical data         | `PROTOBUF_HISTORICAL_DATA`     |         208 |
| News                    | `PROTOBUF_NEWS_DATA`           |         209 |
| Scanner                 | `PROTOBUF_SCAN_DATA`           |         210 |
| REST batch 1            | `PROTOBUF_REST_MESSAGES_1`     |         211 |
| REST batch 2            | `PROTOBUF_REST_MESSAGES_2`     |         212 |
| REST batch 3            | `PROTOBUF_REST_MESSAGES_3`     |         213 |

End-state: raise the floor to `PROTOBUF_REST_MESSAGES_3` (213). Every text-decode branch becomes dead code and can be deleted along with the helpers below.

## Inventory of legacy text-protocol surface

### Decoders that still parse text

Per-domain counts. "Text-decoders" = functions consuming `ResponseMessage`
field-by-field (`message.skip()`, `next_string()`, …). "Proto-decoders" =
functions consuming protobuf bytes. "Dual-format calls" = number of
`decode_proto_or_text{,_owned}` call sites in the module — the pre-existing
text decoders are still load-bearing for servers below the family's gate.

| Domain                                    | Text-decoders | Proto-decoders | Dual-format calls |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------:|---------------:|------------------:|
| `accounts/common/decoders/`               |            14 |             10 |                12 |
| `contracts/common/decoders/`              |             1 |              4 |                 0 |
| `orders/common/decoders/`                 |             0 |              5 |                 1 |
| `market_data/realtime/common/decoders/`   |             2 |             13 |                 1 |
| `market_data/historical/common/decoders/` |             8 |              9 |                 9 |
| `news/common/decoders.rs`                 |             1 |              4 |                 0 |
| `scanner/common/decoders.rs`              |             0 |              2 |                 0 |
| `wsh/common/decoders.rs`                  |             3 |              2 |                 0 |
| `display_groups/common/decoders.rs`       |             1 |              1 |                 0 |

Most domains now have proto counterparts and `decode_proto_or_text` wrappers
in place — the remaining work in §"Per-domain done checklist" is mostly
*deleting* the text branch once the floor passes the family's gate, not
adding proto decoders. Realtime market data and orders still have the largest
text-decoder surface.

### Floor 210 deletions (unlocked, follow-up PRs)

Floor is now `PROTOBUF_SCAN_DATA` (210). Already-shipped deletions:

- `decode_execution_data` (orders) — proto-only since [#529](https://github.com/wboayue/rust-ibapi/pull/529)
- `decode_commission_report` (orders) — proto-only since [#529](https://github.com/wboayue/rust-ibapi/pull/529)
- `decode_order_status` (orders) — proto-only since [#531](https://github.com/wboayue/rust-ibapi/pull/531)
- `decode_scanner_data`, `decode_scanner_parameters` (scanner) — proto-only since [#532](https://github.com/wboayue/rust-ibapi/pull/532)
- `decode_contract_details`, `decode_contract_descriptions`, `decode_market_rule`, `decode_option_chain` (contracts) — proto-only at floor 210; `decode_option_computation` stays text (shared with realtime market_data)
- `decode_news_providers`, `decode_news_bulletin`, `decode_historical_news`, `decode_news_article` (news) — proto-only at floor 210; `decode_tick_news` stays text (gate 206 PROTOBUF_MARKET_DATA, deferred to realtime cleanup)
- `decode_open_order`, `decode_completed_order` (orders) — proto-only since [#539](https://github.com/wboayue/rust-ibapi/pull/539); deleted `OrderDecoder` (~750 lines) + 6 condition text decoders + `decode_open_order_borrowed` wrapper; added `OpenOrderResponse` / `CompletedOrderResponse` field-minimal builders
- `decode_realtime_bar`, `decode_trade_tick`, `decode_bid_ask_tick`, `decode_mid_point_tick` (gate 208), and `decode_market_depth`, `decode_market_depth_l2`, `decode_tick_price`, `decode_tick_size`, `decode_tick_string`, `decode_tick_generic`, `decode_tick_option_computation`, `decode_tick_request_parameters`, `decode_market_data_type` (gate 206) — proto-only at floor 210 in this PR; added 3 new tick-by-tick proto decoders (`decode_trade_tick_proto` / `decode_bid_ask_tick_proto` / `decode_mid_point_tick_proto`) over `proto::TickByTickData`; moved `decode_real_time_bar_proto` from historical → realtime; dropped `context.server_version` plumbing through the dispatcher; added `realtime/common/test_helpers.rs` for shared sync/async test fixtures. `decode_tick_efp` stays text-only (no server proto). `decode_market_depth_exchanges` stays dual-format (gate 213).

Decoders whose text branch is now unreachable at floor 210 and can be deleted
in follow-up PRs (originating outgoing-request gates all ≤ 210):

- `accounts/common/decoders/` — `RequestPositions` / `RequestAccountUpdates` etc. gate 207
- `market_data/historical/common/decoders/` — `RequestHistoricalData` etc. gate 208
- `news/common/decoders.rs` — `decode_tick_news` left over (gate 206 PROTOBUF_MARKET_DATA), to fold into a follow-up
- `contracts/common/decoders/` — `decode_option_computation` left over (gate 206), to fold into a follow-up

Decoders that **stay** dual-format at floor 210 because at least one
originating outgoing-request gate is > 210:

- `decode_next_valid_id` — `RequestIds` and `StartApi` handshake (gate 213)
- WSH event data decoders — `RequestWshEventData` (REST batch ≥ 211)
- Display groups decoders — `QueryDisplayGroups` etc. (REST batch ≥ 211)

Each follow-up PR should ground its family's response-format mapping in
captured wire data before deleting; 213 (`PROTOBUF_REST_MESSAGES_3`) is the
final ratchet that unlocks the remaining decoders and lets us collapse the
dual-format machinery (`decode_proto_or_text`, `is_protobuf` field, etc.).

### Helper APIs that go away when all decoders are proto-only

These exist solely to support text-format messages. Each can be deleted once no decoder reads from a text-format `ResponseMessage`.

- `messages::ResponseMessage::is_protobuf` field (`src/messages.rs:879`)
- `messages::ResponseMessage::from(fields: &str)` inherent constructor (`src/messages.rs:1298`) — note: not a `From<&str>` impl, despite the name
- `messages::ResponseMessage::from_binary_text` (`src/messages.rs:898`)
- `messages::ResponseMessage::with_server_version` (`src/messages.rs:1320`)
- `messages::ResponseMessage::decode_proto_or_text{,_owned}` (`src/messages.rs:916, 931`)
- `connection::common::parse_raw_message` (`src/connection/common.rs:368`) — the pre-`PROTOBUF` `else` branch (lines 384-389) is **already unreachable** at floor 203 and can be deleted whenever convenient; the binary-text-payload branch (lines 377-383) stays load-bearing until floor 213
- All `message.skip()` calls (currently used to skip the text-format `message_type` and `message_version` header fields)

### Branching sites in production code

`if message.is_protobuf` decisions outside the decoder bodies. Each disappears with the field.

- `src/messages.rs:921, 936` — inside `decode_proto_or_text{,_owned}`
- `src/messages.rs:1024, 1033, 1434` — proto-aware `peek_*` accessors and `From<&ResponseMessage> for Notice` (per rule 22)
- `src/errors.rs:116` — inside `From<ResponseMessage> for Error`
- `src/transport/routing.rs:105` — error decode dispatch (proto envelope vs text fields)
- `src/connection/common.rs:200, 213` — handshake `NextValidId` / `ManagedAccounts` parsing

### Sentinel-message uses of the text constructor

Production sentinels have moved off `ResponseMessage::from(&str)` — the
`Cancelled` / `ConnectionReset` paths now send `Error::*` directly via the
`From<Error> for RoutedItem` impl in `subscriptions/common.rs:67`. Remaining
production callers of `ResponseMessage::from(&str)` are limited to:

- `src/display_groups/common/decoders.rs:41` and `src/display_groups/common/stream_decoders.rs:51` — wrapping a parsed text payload after server-side framing; replace when display groups gets a proto decoder.
- `src/connection/common.rs:387` — text-path branch of `parse_raw_message`; dead at floor 210 (server_version < `PROTOBUF` cannot occur).
- `src/stubs.rs:99` — test-fixture-only (the legacy `with_responses(Vec<String>)` path).

The `"stray\0"` sentinel for `UnexpectedResponse` is now test-only
(`src/subscriptions/sync_tests.rs`, `src/subscriptions/async_tests.rs`); no
production code emits it.

## Strategy

Two viable paths, not mutually exclusive:

1. **Per-family ratchet.** Pick a family, bump the floor to its gate (e.g. raise `require_protobuf_support` minimum from 210 to 211 for REST batch 1 — extending the gate landed in [#492](https://github.com/wboayue/rust-ibapi/pull/492)), convert that domain's decoders to proto-only, delete the text branches and any `decode_proto_or_text` wrappers in that domain, ship. Repeat for the next family.
2. **Big-bang.** Raise the floor to 213 (`PROTOBUF_REST_MESSAGES_3`) in one PR, convert all remaining decoders to proto-only, delete the helpers, ship. Larger blast radius but ends the carrying cost in one move.

Either path ends at the same place: only the proto branches remain, the helpers in §"Helper APIs that go away" are deleted, and `ResponseMessage` collapses to a thin protobuf-payload carrier (or is replaced entirely).

## Per-domain "done" checklist

For each row in the decoder table:

1. Add a proto-decoder for every response type in the domain that doesn't already have one (mirror the patterns in `src/proto/decoders.rs` and the accounts dual-format trio). Most domains now have proto counterparts — see the proto-decoders column.
2. Wrap each domain decoder in `decode_proto_or_text` *or* delete the text branch outright (depending on whether the floor has passed the family's gate).
3. Raise the floor so the text branch is unreachable: bump the constant in `connection::common::require_protobuf_support` (the gate added by [#492](https://github.com/wboayue/rust-ibapi/pull/492)) to the family's `PROTOBUF_<FAMILY>` value, or — if the bump would be too aggressive globally — add a per-feature `check_version` call at the public API entry point.
4. Delete the text branches and update the corresponding `_tests.rs` to drive proto fixtures only.
5. `cargo test` (default + `--features sync` + `--all-features`), `cargo clippy --all-targets [-- -D warnings]` for each configuration, `cargo fmt`.
6. Update this file: drop the row from the inventory.

## Final-cleanup checklist (after all rows are gone)

- Delete the helpers listed under "Helper APIs that go away".
- Delete the `is_protobuf` branches listed under "Branching sites in production code".
- Replace the remaining `ResponseMessage::from(&str)` callers (display_groups decoders, `parse_raw_message` text branch) with proto equivalents, then delete the inherent `from(fields: &str)` constructor and `from_binary_text`.
- Simplify `ResponseMessage` to a protobuf-only payload carrier, or delete it in favor of using `prost`-decoded message types directly on the channels.
- Bump the major version if any of the above breaks public API (most of the helpers above are `pub`).

## Source of truth

The same C# constants file the outgoing tracker uses:
`/Users/wboayue/projects/tws-api/source/csharpclient/client/Constants.cs` (`PROTOBUF_MSG_IDS`).
A message family is "protobuf-incoming" iff its message ID appears in that map at the relevant min-server-version.
