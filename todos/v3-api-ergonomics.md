# v3.0 Public API Ergonomics — Tracking Doc

A living checklist of public-API rough edges to address before 3.0 ships. Goal:
the API should feel **simple, ergonomic, easy to use, and intuitive** — minimal
ceremony, no stringly-typed escape hatches, one obvious way to do each thing.

**Last audited:** 2026-05-07 (against `main` post-PR #524).

## How to use this doc

- One bullet per concrete change. Keep them small and independently shippable.
- Each item: **status · problem · proposal · breaking? · notes**.
- Status: `[ ]` open · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` shipped · `[-]` rejected (note why).
- When an item ships, leave it checked here with the PR link for ~one cycle, then prune.
- File a separate `todos/<topic>.md` for any item large enough to need its own plan
  and link it from here.

## 1. Construction & builders

- [ ] **Forbid bare `Contract { ... }` construction.** Today `Contract::stock(...).build()`
  is the blessed path, but examples (e.g. `examples/async/place_order.rs:22`) still
  build the struct field-by-field with `..Default::default()`. Fields are `pub`, so
  there's no compile-time push toward the builder.
  - Proposal: make required fields private (or wrap in newtypes that only the builder
    can construct), keep `pub` on getters; or `#[non_exhaustive]` + private constructor.
  - Breaking: yes (intentional for 3.0).

- [x] **Newtype ergonomics: take `impl Into<Symbol>` / `&str` everywhere.** Shipped.
  `Symbol`, `Exchange`, `Currency` impl `From<&str>` + `From<String>` (`src/contracts/types.rs:24,85,141`)
  and the contract builder methods take `impl Into<String>` (`src/contracts/common/contract_builder/mod.rs:330`).
  Verified 2026-05-06.

- [ ] **Converge order construction on one style.** Two coexisting paths today:
  - `order_builder::limit_order(Action::Buy, 100.0, 150.0)` (free fn, returns `Order`)
  - `client.order(&c).buy(100).limit(150.0).submit()` (fluent, owns submission)

  Pick the fluent one as canonical, keep the free fns as a thin convenience layer
  documented as "advanced — bring your own order id." Remove the per-method
  `Action::Buy` argument once the side is implied by `.buy()` / `.sell()`.

- [ ] **Drop `client.next_order_id()` from the canonical happy path.** `submit()` already
  allocates an id internally; the only caller that still needs `next_order_id()` is
  the low-level `place_order(order_id, contract, order)` form. Examples still show it
  at `examples/async/place_order.rs:32, 100, 103`. Either:
  - keep `next_order_id()` for advanced callers but stop showing it in examples; or
  - hide it behind `client.advanced()` / a feature flag and have `place_order` accept
    `Option<i32>`.

## 2. Streaming surface

- [x] **`SubscriptionItem<T>` consistency.** Shipped in PR #517 — per-T `Notice`
  variants deleted; notices route through `SubscriptionItem::Notice` and the
  dedicated `NoticeStream`. Same PR removed the dead untyped `Err` arms.

- [ ] **Standardize the consumer interface on `Stream` (async) and `Iterator` (sync).**
  Today consumers call `subscription.next_data().await` (see
  `examples/async/place_order.rs:47`). For async this should be `StreamExt::next`,
  and for sync the `for item in subscription` form should be the default in examples.
  - Decision needed: keep `next_data()` as a thin alias, or remove and force `Stream`?
  - Breaking: yes if we remove.

- [ ] **Notice classification helpers.** Today callers reach for `notice.code` ranges
  to decide "warning" vs "rejection" vs "system message" (some predicates already
  exist on `Notice` — `is_warning`, `is_system_message` — but no public taxonomy
  on the wire-error ranges). Provide:
  - `Notice::is_order_rejection()` (codes 200–399), `Notice::category() -> NoticeCategory`.
  - Precedent: `OrderStatusKind::is_terminal()` (PR #518) — table-driven typed
    classifier, no magic numbers at the call site.

- [x] **`OrderStatus.status: String` → `OrderStatusKind` enum.** Shipped in PR #518
  (commit `b9ed884`). `src/orders/mod.rs:1557` is `pub status: OrderStatusKind` with
  `is_terminal()` etc. Examples now use `.is_terminal()` (lines 61, 143).

- [ ] **Continue the typed-status sweep.** `OrderState.status`, contract `secIdType`,
  exec `side`, and any other `String` fields whose wire vocabulary is enumerated.
  Follow the PR #518 pattern (per `CLAUDE.md` rule 21): strict enum, `Display`
  round-trips, decoder rejects empty/missing as `Error::Parse`. **First**: grep
  captured-wire fixtures + the C# reference to confirm the field is actually
  enumerated (rule 21 caveat — `OrderState.completed_status` looked enumerated
  but is free-form text).

- [ ] **One canonical `Subscription` import path.** `Subscription` is reachable from
  `crate::subscriptions::Subscription` (canonical at `src/subscriptions/mod.rs:32,35`),
  `crate::client::Subscription` (`src/client/mod.rs:34`), and `crate::prelude::Subscription`
  (feature-gated at `src/prelude.rs:51-53`). Pick `crate::subscriptions::Subscription`
  as canonical and keep the others as `pub use` aliases (or remove the client-level paths).

- [ ] **`NoticeStream` should not mirror `Subscription`'s sync/async toggle in the
  prelude.** Today the prelude conditionally re-exports a sync vs async `NoticeStream`.
  Either expose distinct `NoticeStream` / `BlockingNoticeStream` types, or keep a single
  type whose API is the same shape and only differs in `await`.

- [ ] **Unify the two notice APIs.** `ConnectionOptions::startup_notice_callback` (pre-connect,
  handshake-only) and `Client::notice_stream()` (post-connect, lifetime of the connection)
  deliver the same data with a lifecycle gap, and the callback's window has a race against
  gateway message ordering. Pick one canonical surface.
  - Plan: [`notice-api-unification.md`](notice-api-unification.md).
  - Breaking: yes.

## 3. Naming, layout, prelude

- [ ] **Eliminate prelude collisions.** `BarSize` and `WhatToShow` exist for both
  historical and realtime market data and are re-exported as `HistoricalBarSize` /
  `RealtimeBarSize` in the prelude (`src/prelude.rs:31-34`). Options:
  - Rename one (e.g. `RealtimeBarSize` already differs in variants — rename in source
    too, drop the alias).
  - Or keep the aliases but document them as the canonical names.

- [ ] **Async-vs-blocking naming asymmetry.** `ibapi::Client` is the async client when
  `async` is on; the sync client lives at `ibapi::client::blocking::Client`
  (`src/client/mod.rs:15`). `async` is a reserved keyword so a literal
  `client::async::Client` path needs `r#async` (already used internally). Decision:
  either (a) keep the asymmetry and document `Client` (root) + `client::blocking::Client`
  as the two canonical paths, or (b) expose `client::r#async::Client` as a sibling
  for symmetry in docs/examples.

- [ ] **Reorganize re-exports out of `orders` for non-order types.** `TagValue` is
  re-exported from `orders` (`src/orders/mod.rs:67`) for historical reasons. Move to
  `contracts` (or wherever it logically belongs) and drop the alias.

- [ ] **Hide internal types from the public surface.** Audit `pub` items that look
  like plumbing:
  - `Client::message_bus()` (`src/client/async.rs:391`) and `Client::stubbed()`
    (`src/client/async.rs:374`) — both `pub` on the async side; sync has neither
    in its public signature, so the async exposure looks accidental.
  - `subscriptions::common::SubscriptionItem` (re-exported at module root — fine, but
    confirm `DecoderContext`, `StreamDecoder` stay `pub(crate)`)
  - `pub mod messages` and `pub mod proto` (`src/lib.rs:111, 131`) — confirm what
    consumers actually need versus what's just exposed for tests/examples; consider
    `#[doc(hidden)]` for the advanced bits.

## 4. Connection API

- [ ] **Fold connect variants into a builder.** Today there are three on each side
  (sync `src/client/sync.rs:62, 105, 132`; async `src/client/async.rs:66, 112, 142`):
  `connect`, `connect_with_callback`, `connect_with_options`. Replace with:
  ```rust
  Client::builder("127.0.0.1:4002", 100)
      .startup_callback(cb)
      .options(opts)
      .connect()
      .await?;
  ```
  Keep `Client::connect(addr, id)` as the one-liner; deprecate the rest. Note: the
  notice-API unification (`notice-api-unification.md` option 3) suggests doing this
  refactor first so per-feature builders can use native broadcaster types.

- [x] **`StartupMessageCallback` builder ergonomics.** Shipped — the
  `ConnectionOptions::startup_callback` builder method accepts
  `impl Fn(StartupMessage) + Send + Sync + 'static` and boxes internally
  (`src/connection/common.rs:122`). The type alias `StartupMessageCallback`
  (`src/connection/common.rs:67`) is still `Box<dyn Fn(...)>`, but it's no longer
  on the call-site path.

## 5. Errors

- [ ] **Audit remaining `Error::Simple` / `Error::Message` callers.** Enum is
  `#[non_exhaustive]` (`src/errors.rs:18`) and the typed variants predominate
  (`Io`, `Parse`, `ServerVersion`, `ConnectionFailed`, `ConnectionReset`,
  `Cancelled`, `Shutdown`, `EndOfStream`, `UnexpectedResponse`,
  `UnsupportedTimeZone`, `InvalidArgument`, etc.). Continue splitting the
  remaining `Simple(format!(...))` / `Message` sites into typed variants where
  downstream code would plausibly match (auth failure, request timeout, …).

- [ ] **Distinguish "request rejected by server" from "transport error" in return
  types.** Today both come through `Result<_, Error>`. Consider promoting server-side
  rejections (TWS error codes 200-299, 300-399, 10000+) into a typed sub-enum so
  callers can pattern-match without string parsing.

## 6. Examples & docs

- [ ] **Modernize every example to use the canonical happy path.** After the
  decisions above land, sweep `examples/sync/*.rs` and `examples/async/*.rs`:
  - `Contract::stock("AAPL").build()` not bare struct literals.
  - `client.order(c).buy(n).limit(p).submit()` for orders (drop `next_order_id`
    boilerplate where possible).
  - `while let Some(item) = stream.next().await` for streams.
  - No magic-number notice code comparisons.

- [x] **Migration guide created.** `docs/migration-3.0.md` exists. Keep updating it
  in lockstep with breaking changes (see `CLAUDE.md` § "Keep `README.md` and
  `docs/migration-3.0.md` in sync with v3.0 work" — this is enforced as a PR-time
  check, not a one-shot deliverable).

- [ ] **Consolidate the docs index.** `docs/api-patterns.md` and `docs/contract-builder.md`
  overlap. Merge or cross-link cleanly so the prelude + builders are documented in one
  obvious place.

## 7. Cross-cutting

- [ ] **One way to spell each thing.** After the moves above, audit for duplicate
  re-exports (`pub use foo::Bar;` in two modules). The crate root, `prelude`, and the
  domain module should each pick one home for each type.

- [ ] **`#[non_exhaustive]` on every public enum and struct that may grow.** Avoids
  future breaking releases for additive variants/fields. Sweep before 3.0 cuts.

- [ ] **`#[must_use]` on every builder and `Subscription`.** Forgetting `.subscribe()`
  / `.submit()` / `.build()` should produce a lint, not silent no-ops.

- [x] **No `block_on` in async paths.** Verified clean across `src/` on 2026-05-06
  (no `futures::executor::block_on` usages). Project rule (`CLAUDE.md` §10) keeps
  it that way.
