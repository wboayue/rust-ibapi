//! Client implementation with sync/async support.
//!
//! ## Canonical paths
//!
//! Two canonical spellings for the `Client` type, depending on which client
//! you want and which features are enabled:
//!
//! - **Async client** — `ibapi::Client`. The crate-root `Client` re-export
//!   resolves to the async client whenever the `async` feature is on (which
//!   is the default).
//! - **Blocking (sync) client** — `ibapi::client::blocking::Client`. The
//!   labelled `blocking` submodule is the canonical sync-explicit path. Use
//!   it whenever both `sync` and `async` features are enabled, since the root
//!   `ibapi::Client` resolves to async in that configuration. When only `sync`
//!   is enabled, `ibapi::Client` also resolves to the blocking client.
//!
//! The `client::sync` and `client::r#async` submodules where the impls live
//! are `#[doc(hidden)]`: still reachable as paths for crate-internal use, but
//! intentionally absent from the docs.rs navigation. Prefer the root `Client`
//! / `client::blocking::Client` spellings in user code, examples, and docs.
//! Raw-identifier syntax (`client::r#async::Client`) is the giveaway that the
//! spelling is non-canonical.
