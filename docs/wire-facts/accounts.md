# Accounts wire facts

Positions and PnL. End-marker behavior for account streams is in
[protocol](protocol.md#end-markers-come-after-the-initial-dump-only). Format: [README](README.md).

### Flat position sends `"0"`

*Live 2026-10-26, paper Gateway, EUR.USD 25k buy then sell; #1088.*

- After closing, Position and PositionMulti frames carry `position = "0"`. TWS does not omit
  a zero quantity, so an absent `position` is not the flat case and decoding it as required
  does not end streams on a close.
- PnLSingle on the flat position also sent `"0"`.
- `pnl_single` for a never-held conid sends no frame at all (held ones get a 2150 notice
  first).
- **Not probed:** PortfolioValue (forex is not in the portfolio; needs STK in RTH).
