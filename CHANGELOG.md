# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `ConnectivityStatus` enum with `ConnectivityStatus::from_code()` and `Notice::connectivity_status()` to expose data-farm connectivity sub-states (Ok / Broken / Inactive / Connecting) within the 2100–2169 warning band (#684).
- `Error::is_connection_lost()` predicate so reconnect loops can branch on connection loss without matching internal error variants (#690).

## [3.1.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- `DATA_ADVISORY_CODES`, `Notice::is_data_advisory()`, and the `NoticeCategory::DataAdvisory` variant for delayed-market-data advisory codes (#680).

### Changed

- Benign data-farm connectivity notices (codes 2104/2106/2158, "…connection is OK") now log at `info` instead of `warn`, removing warn-level spam on long-running sessions (#678).

### Fixed

- Delayed-data advisories (codes 10089/10167) no longer terminate a market-data subscription before its data arrives (#677).
- `TickSubscription` now carries the `SubscriptionItem` envelope (#675).
