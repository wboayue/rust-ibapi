## Architecture & Design Issues

### Shared Channel Routing Logic Discrepancy
**Priority:** High  
**Components:** `transport/sync.rs`, `transport/async.rs`, `transport/routing.rs`  
**Issue:** The sync and async implementations use different approaches for routing messages to shared channels:

- **Sync implementation:** 
  - Uses `CHANNEL_MAPPINGS` from `shared_channel_configuration.rs` to configure channels at startup
  - Routes messages by directly checking if a sender exists: `shared_channels.contains_sender(message.message_type())`
  - Single source of truth for channel mappings

- **Async implementation:**
  - Also uses `CHANNEL_MAPPINGS` for initial channel setup
  - BUT uses a separate `map_incoming_to_outgoing()` function in `routing.rs` for response routing
  - Two sources of truth that must be kept manually in sync

**Impact:** This inconsistency can lead to bugs where a channel is configured but responses aren't routed (as happened with `FamilyCodes` and `MarketRule`). This also affects integration testing where async tests fail while sync tests pass.

**Proposed Solutions:**
1. **Option A:** Modify async to use the same approach as sync (check channel existence directly)
2. **Option B:** Generate `map_incoming_to_outgoing()` from `CHANNEL_MAPPINGS` to ensure consistency
3. **Option C:** Consolidate both implementations to use a unified routing strategy

**Related Files:**
- `/src/messages/shared_channel_configuration.rs` - Contains `CHANNEL_MAPPINGS`
- `/src/transport/routing.rs` - Contains `map_incoming_to_outgoing()`
- `/src/transport/sync.rs` - Sync message routing (lines 281-289)
- `/src/transport/async.rs` - Async message routing (lines 310-320)

## Testing Gaps

### Integration Test Coverage
**Priority:** Medium  
**Issue:** Only ~15% of client methods have integration tests using MockGateway

See `CLIENT_INTEGRATION_TEST_TRACKING.md` for detailed coverage information.
