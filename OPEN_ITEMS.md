## Architecture & Design Issues

### ~~Shared Channel Routing Logic Discrepancy~~ âœ… RESOLVED
**Status:** Resolved (2025-08-10)  
**Resolution:** Implemented Option A - Modified async implementation to match sync's approach

The async implementation now:
- Uses the same `CHANNEL_MAPPINGS` to build a map of `IncomingMessages -> Vec<BroadcastSender>`
- Checks channel existence directly (like sync) instead of using `map_incoming_to_outgoing()`
- Routes order messages to shared channels when no specific order channel exists
- The `map_incoming_to_outgoing()` function has been removed

All tests now pass in both sync and async modes.

## Testing Gaps

### Integration Test Coverage
**Priority:** Medium  
**Issue:** Only ~15% of client methods have integration tests using MockGateway

See `CLIENT_INTEGRATION_TEST_TRACKING.md` for detailed coverage information.
